//In a board game, a piece may advance 1-6 tiles forward depending on the number rolled on a six-sided dice. If you advance your piece onto the same tile as another player's piece, both of you earn a bonus.Given you and your friend's tile number, create a function that returns if it's possible to earn a bonus when you roll the dice.Examples 
// possibleBonus(3, 7) ➞ true
// possibleBonus(1, 9) ➞ false
// possibleBonus(5, 3) ➞ false
// Notes
// You cannot move backward (which is why example #3 doesn't work).
// If you are already on the same tile, return false, as you would be advancing away.
// Expect only positive integer inputs.

const possible = (a, b) => {
  let x = a;
  let y = b;
  for (let i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
    x += 1;
    if (x === y) {
      return true;
    } 
  }
  return false;
};

console.log(possible(3, 7));
console.log(possible(1, 9));
console.log(possible(5, 3));
console.log(possible(5, 5));
